# Adding an Application Workflow

Use a workflow when building a focused tool—such as an inventory collector, configuration reviewer, report generator, or approved remediation flow—on top of this framework.

## Recipe

1. Create `src/workflows/<feature>.js`.
2. Export a function accepting `{ sessions, sessionId, context }`.
3. Call `sessions.command()`, `sessions.list()`, or `sessions.runScript()` as appropriate.
4. Return a small, app-specific result object.
5. Add a local route in `src/server.js` if the browser needs to invoke the workflow.
6. Build the focused UI in `public/`; do not connect the browser directly to Check Point.
7. Add tests for the workflow and any modified framework behavior.

## Example

```js
// src/workflows/gateway-inventory.js
export async function collectGatewayInventory({ sessions, sessionId, context = "primary" }) {
  const gateways = await sessions.list(
    sessionId,
    "show-gateways-and-servers",
    {},
    context
  );
  return {
    count: gateways.length,
    gateways: gateways.map(({ name, type, uid }) => ({ name, type, uid }))
  };
}
```

For a Gaia operation, use the framework's asynchronous task flow:

```js
const result = await sessions.runScript(sessionId, {
  "script-name": "get-version",
  script: 'clish -c "show version all"',
  targets: [gatewayName]
}, "mds");

// result.taskSummary contains task state and target-associated output/errors.
```

## Context Selection

- Use `primary` for the selected SMS, Smart-1 Cloud tenant, or MDS domain/CMA.
- Use `mds` for MDS-level operations and MDS-managed gateway targets.
- Use `global` only for Global Domain operations.
- Use `system-data` only for System Data operations.

Never silently change context just because one is unavailable. Surface a clear error and let the application make an intentional choice.

## State-Changing Workflows

For an action that changes Management or gateway state:

- require an explicit user confirmation;
- clearly identify the context, target, and change before execution;
- return the task ID and target-associated result;
- document prerequisites, rollback, and operational risk;
- avoid automatically publishing or installing policy unless the user explicitly requested that behavior.

## Avoid These Anti-Patterns

- Calling Check Point endpoints from browser JavaScript.
- Recreating `login`, `show-task` polling, pagination, or URL handling inside a workflow.
- Reading credentials from source code or browser storage.
- Running one `run-script` call per gateway in an unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Returning only a raw task blob when clean per-target output is available.
