# Adding Gaia Run-Script Presets

The preset catalog at `public/data/gateway-run-script-presets.json` is the reusable library for Gaia commands shown in the UI. Add a preset when a command is broadly useful and can be described safely.

## Preset Shape

```json
{
  "id": "unique-kebab-case-id",
  "name": "Readable Command Name",
  "script": "gaia command here",
  "description": "What it collects or changes.",
  "tags": ["Category", "Purpose"],
  "risk": "safe"
}
```

Use one of these risk levels:

| Risk | Use for | UI behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `safe` | Read-only monitoring or information collection | Runs without an extra confirmation. |
| `caution` | Actions that trigger a check, update, install, stop a service, or change configuration | Shows a change warning and requires confirmation. |
| `danger` | Commands that disable protection, revert a patch, remove configuration, or have significant impact | Shows a high-risk warning and requires confirmation. |

## Rules

- Keep scripts literal and reviewable; never interpolate unchecked text into a preset.
- Prefer read-only commands when the goal is collection.
- Include required placeholders clearly, such as `/full/path/package.tar`.
- Do not add destructive commands as `safe`.
- Do not automatically execute a preset merely because it is selected.
- If a command is version-, platform-, Maestro-, or support-guidance-specific, state that in the description and tags.
- Add a test assertion in `test/framework.test.js` for any important new preset or risk classification.

## Result Handling

The framework decodes the Check Point task's Base64 `responseMessage` and presents outputs per gateway. A command can return a task status without output, or a mix of successful and failed targets. Preserve all of these results; do not reduce them to a single success/failure string.
